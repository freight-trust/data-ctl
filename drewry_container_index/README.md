### Motivation & Reasoning

Data Quality Auditing Reproducibility Informational Transparency

**Data Lineage** includes the data’s origins, what happens to it and where it
moves over time. Data lineage gives visibility while greatly simplifying the
ability to trace errors back to the root cause in a data analytics process.

**Data Provenance** refers to records of the inputs, entities, systems, and
processes that influence data of interest, providing a historical record of the
data and its origins. The generated evidence supports forensic activities such
as data-dependency analysis, error/compromise detection and recovery, auditing,
and compliance analysis.

SHA-256 hashes used properly can confirm both file integrity and authenticity.

Comparing hashes makes it possible to detect changes in files that would cause
errors. The possibility of changes (errors) is proportional to the size of the
file; the possibility of errors increase as the file becomes larger.
